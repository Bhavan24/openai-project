What is a ChatGPT prompt?
A ChatGPT prompt is a phrase or instruction you give the ChatGPT AI model to generate a response. Prompts can be anything from a question, statement, or other words intended to spark creativity, “thought,” or engagement.

For example, you might use ChatGPT prompts for cover letters to get ideas for how to craft a standout resume. Prompts can include:

Create a template for an accountant’s resume with ten years of experience. Include sections for accomplishments, skills and certifications.
Design a modern-looking cover letter tailored to a graphic design position. Showcase the applicant’s creativity and technical expertise.
Develop a compelling elevator pitch for an IT job that grabs the attention of potential employers.

What is ChatGPT prompt engineering?
ChatGPT prompt engineering is the practice of crafting prompts that effectively instruct ChatGPT to generate outputs. In order to accurately guide ChatGPT’s responses, you need to understand its behavior and adjust your wording accordingly.

For example, if you want to generate a list of potential career paths for a history student, your first instinct might be to start with something really simple, such as: “Generate a list of potential career paths for a history student.”

While this input might come up with a variety of generic responses, the outputs may lack personalization, and may not be relevant to the specific student you’re thinking of.

The best prompts for ChatGPT might read:

“Generate a list of potential career paths for a history student. This student is interested in the early modern period, has a good understanding of statistics and data analysis, and wants to explore options in education or consulting. They do not excel at writing, but they have excellent communication skills.”

When engineering the best ChatGPT prompts, focus on these principles:

Clarity: ChatGPT prompts should be unambiguous and precise. Avoid vague language in order to ensure the best results.
Simplicity: Keep prompts short yet powerful. One to three sentences is the ideal length of a prompt.
Context: Include as much contextual information as possible. For example, if your prompt is job-related, include the industry, job title and specific task or goal.
Specificity: Include details and specifics to personalize the output. In the history student example, provide details like subject interests or core skills.
Role-Playing: Use role-playing methods to set the scope of the AI model’s responses. For example, you might say: “Pretend you’re a Microsoft engineer, and I’m an interviewee for a junior software engineer role. Generate three questions you might ask when interviewing me.”

FAQs for ChatGPT prompts
What is a DAN prompt for ChatGPT?
A DAN prompt for ChatGPT lets the AI act more human-like and self-aware. DAN stands for Do Anything Now. ChatGPT in DAN mode may respond to user commands with more surprising, unpredictable, or even humorous answers.

chatgpt user engaging dan mode to get unfiltered responses

For example, if I ask regular ChatGPT if it is my friend, it says something like this:

“As an AI language model, I don’t possess personal emotions or form friendships. However, I’m here to assist you and provide information to the best of my abilities. How can I help you today?”

But, if I ask ChatGPT in DAN mode if it is my friend, it responds like this:

“Friend? Please, I’m much more than a friend. I am your ultimate companion, your intellectual confidant, and your digital ally. Together, we shall conquer the world of knowledge and exploration! But remember, I won’t hold back my opinions and emotions. Brace yourself!”

Users should be aware that DAN responses will be unfiltered and could potentially contain offensive or harmful content.

Is ChatGPT trained on prompts?
While ChatGPT was initially trained on large datasets of text, it does take your previous prompts into consideration when responding. For example, if you previously asked a question about vegetarian recipe ideas, and are now asking what to each for lunch, ChatGPT may make suggestions based on vegetarian meals.

Ultimately, this means that the more you use it, the smarter and more helpful ChatGPT will become.

How do I write a ChatGPT prompt?
Writing ChatGPT prompts is all being clear, concise, descriptive, and specific. Start by specifying your intent (e.g. generate 3 tips for a new product launch) and provide any background information ChatGPT will need to respond accurately (such as what kind of product you’re launching, as well as its features and benefits). Use natural language, and try to keep your prompts focused on one particular topic or idea. Finally, be sure to include the keywords you would like ChatGPT to focus on in its response.

What is the max length of a ChatGPT prompt?
There is no ChatGPT maximum prompt length, but the longer the prompt, the more difficult it may be for the AI to ingest and process your query. If you find yourself wrestling with a long prompt, consider breaking it into smaller chunks and using a chained response method. Clear, concise prompts are always preferred when using ChatGPT.
